# Earthquake Visualization Project

[View the Interactive Map](map.html)

This project details the creation of an interactive earthquake monitoring system that leverages real-time data from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API. The process began with the establishment of a well-organized folder structure and the configuration of a static site using a Jekyll theme hosted on GitHub Pages. 

The interactive map was developed using open-source tools such as Leaflet, which provided dynamic mapping capabilities, and Chart.js, which was used to generate insightful data visualizations. A single drop-down control was implemented to select various time frames, influencing both the map markers and the accompanying charts. 

Key steps involved the integration of real-time earthquake data, the creation of a visually engaging dark-themed interface with grey and orange accents, and the use of responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices. The outcome is a comprehensive platform that displays up-to-date seismic activity along with trend analyses via charts.
